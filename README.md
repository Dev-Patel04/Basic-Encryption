# Basic-Encryption
This Python script performs simple encryption and decryption using a substitution cipher. It shuffles a list of characters (including punctuation, digits, and letters) to create a key for encrypting messages. Users can encrypt their input by matching each character's index from the original list to the shuffled key and decrypt similarly.

## Features

- Simple substitution cipher for encryption and decryption.
- Dynamic key generation using a shuffled character set.
